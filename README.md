- 👋 Hi, I’m @Darkhaven7
- 👀 I’m interested in all things involving space, Cognitive Science, and developing my skill in C# and Python. I'm currently an Astrophysics student, but as I need a job while I'm working on my Astrophysics schooling, programming looks to be a fun means to an end.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, C# in Unity, and Python. I want to strengthen my skills in all three, as efficiently and quickly as possible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything to help me round out my portfolio and overall skill. Though, I will admit, I am interested more in gaming, instructional gaming, and cognitive science concepts.
- 📫 How to reach me ...if you can reach me here, that's great. Otherwise, you can email me at: Blackshadowmancer@gmail.com. Just be sure to state that you're reaching out to me based on Github, otherwise I may skip past your email.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He / Him, Creepy / Kooky, Mysterious / Spooky
